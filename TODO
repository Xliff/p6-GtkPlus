+ Mechanism for providing PROPER event handlers for all events (in progress...)
- Insure all method-level gchar paramters are converted to Str()
- COMPLETE a working GSList implementation
- Add a working GList implementation
√ META6.json
√ New dependency: https://github.com/timo/cairo-p6
- GDK
+ Feature Request: GTK::TextBuffer.buffer to accept from Str or Buf. This should also apply to .text()
√ METHOD ALIASING! - This has mostly been accomplished, but in the case of container-based classes and others where manual aliasing was done, the best thing to do would be a proto method. See: https://gist.github.com/Xliff/34b9d2e3e27c76696ec60e6791075634
- Separate all GTK::Compat::Pixbuf files into it's own project, that will become a dependency. GDK::Pixbuf is available.
- Convert Perl6 additions to GTK::Container into a role. (done as GTK::Roles::LatchedContainer)
√ Convert Perl6 additions to GTK::Box into a role. (GTK::Roles::Boxable)
+ Investivate the use of g_object_getv and g_object_setv to access previously non-accessible GObject properties. See https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#g-object-get (MOSTLY DONE! See scripts/prop-get.pl6)
√ Fix lack of icons in GTK::IconView
- Add-to-project-if-I'm-completely-insane: GVariant
- Move signals to %Object.signal<name> to fix issue with method name conflicts
- GTK::ScrolledWindow.new_with_policy is in desperate need of being written
- GTK::Container.set/get-child-properties using var args. Hint: *@slurpys!
- Add type specific signal handling to GTK::Notebook
- Add attribute 'control' to GTK::Stack to allow adding either GtkStackSwitcher or GtkStackSidebar
- Consider refactoring scripts/build-mro.pl6 to generate both widget and non-widget MRO lists.
- Since build.sh is now running scripts/dependencies.pl6 find a way to make it do the full run only if necessary
- Move GTK::Window title and size initialization to BUILD
- Add overflow warnings to appropriate RESOLVE routines in GTK::Roles::Types. Said warnings are NOT under $DEBUG check.
- Adjust constructors for GTK::TextBuffer to accept creation-only properties.
- Inhibit pass-through to Mu constructor in all widget-based objects!
- Add this to the top of all activate blocks in t/
    CATCH { default { .message.say; $app.exit } }
- Rewrite this document in Markdown format.


Applications
============
- A text editor in Perl6. Think about using it as a visual Regex tester (in progress, see p6-VisualGrammar.git)
+ Glade UI to p6-GtkPerl application (in progress see GTK::Builder:: objects and ui-to-code.pl6)
