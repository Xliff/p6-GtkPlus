00B1: PASSED   - Updating needed: Size-Request of top-level window needs to be wider.
00B2: PASSED   - Updating needed: Could reflect the results of the dialog in the GUI
                                  as opposed (or in addition) to the console.
00C0: PASSED   - Updating needed: Size-Request of top-level window needs to be wider.
00C1: PASSED   - Updating needed: Size-Request of top-level window needs to be wider.
                                  Also, reflect the results of the dialog in the GUI
                                  as opposed (or in addition) to the console.
00C2: PASSED
0100: PASSED   - Updating needed: Size-Request of top-level window needs to be wider.
0110: MARGINAL - Downgrade due to the fact that the original size does not match
                 the actual size of the window upon opening. This size is what
                 should be preserved. Restore should return window to this
                 size.
0120: FAILED   - "No such method 'active' for invocant of type 'Array'."
                 Check the return value of GTK::RadioGroup.new;
0130: PASSED   - Note: The GTK::RadioGroup in this example works just fine...
0140: PASSED
0150: PASSED
0170: PASSED
0180: PASSED
0190: PASSED   - Warning received upon exit:
                 "(perl6:3000): Gtk-WARNING **: 23:07:04.759: A floating object was finalized."
0200: PASSED
0210: PASSED
0220: MARGINAL - Improved from last test, however the 3rd drop-down is still linked
                 to its closest sibling. In the refernce example, these have independent
                 widths.
0230: PASSED
0240: PASSED   - Warning received upon exit:
                 "(perl6:5513): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 23:39:05.322: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed"
0250: PASSED
0260: PASSED   - Note: After removal of GTK::Roles::Types references from GTK::TreeStore
0270: MARGINAL - Functionality wise there don't seem to be any problems, however...
                 Message received during execution:
                 "Cannot call method from outside of a GTK:: object (listbox_test.buildListRow)
                  in method IS-PROTECTED..."
                 ... and ...
                 "(perl6:6989): Gtk-WARNING **: 23:57:28.552: A floating object was finalized. ..."
0280: PASSED
0290: PASSED   - Updating needed: Remove extra borders.
0300: PASSED
0310: PASSED   - Note: Numerous instances of the following warning:
                     "(perl6:8472): Gtk-WARNING **: 02:03:37.804: A floating object was finalized.'
0320: PASSED   - Updating needed: Increase initial width of top-level window to insure
                 progress bars are visible.
0330: PASSED   - Note: SEGV occurred when exiting with the following message:
                     'double free or corruption (!prev)' -- Looks like a GList issue
                     Second execution to verify the first message did not, but got the following:
                     "(perl6:9191): Gtk-WARNING **: 02:09:28.083: A floating object was finalized."
                     ...This occurred when dragging one of the bottom icons.
0340: PASSED   - Note: All images shown.
0350: PASSED   - Note: Execution only proceeded successfully after removal of
                     several references to GTK::Roles::Types. Drag and Drop on
                     the ToolPalette is also a problem in the reference
                     implementation. I cannot tell if they are exactly the same,
                     but neither behave as intuition says they should.
                     Also, several GLib messages were emitted upon exit:
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 02:29:25.778: g_signal_handlers_destroy: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed"
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 02:29:25.778: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed"
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: 02:29:25.778: instance with invalid (NULL) class pointer"
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 02:29:25.778: g_signal_emit_valist: assertion 'G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE (instance)' failed"
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 02:29:25.778: g_object_set_qdata: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed"
                     "(perl6:10917): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: 02:29:25.778: instance with invalid (NULL) class pointer"
0360: MARGINAL - Notes: Notebook tabs are shown, but not the blank page as in the reference implementation.
0370: PASSED   - Notes: Need to insure that GTK::PrintOperation was NOT global,
                        or Bad Things Happen.
                 Updating needed: Increase initial width of top-level window.
0380: PASSED
0390: PASSED
0391: PASSED   - Notes: Renamed to denote difference between 0390.
0400: PASSED   - Notes: Warning emitted upon exit:
                        "(perl6:13389): Gtk-WARNING **: 02:58:22.159: A floating object was finalized."
0410: PASSED
0500: PASSED
0520: BROKEN   - Notes: (GTK::Utils::MenuBuilder in the process of being refactored)
0540: BROKEN   - Notes: Floating SEGV when progress bar completes.
0720: PASSED   - Notes: See 0270.
