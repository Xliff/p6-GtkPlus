- Check all occurences of GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer and remove all casts involving the .p method. Those casts are no longer necessary.
  If a cast is to a different type than the role parameter then the call becomes ".p( :!typed )"
- Anywhere method that offers the :glist option, should return ensure they return an Array, not a Seq. If the caller wants a Seq, 
  they should be able to set :$seq, which is the current behavior as of 20200530
- There is still a bit of confusion between setting properties and setting data in GLib::Roles::Object. Please resolve this.
- All methods that return the results of a .map should have that value coerced to an array. This WILL have unforseen consequences,
  but let's hope they are minor. It's either that or have a :$seq var on all routines that defaults to TRUE.
- Complete objects and definitions for GHookList and GHook if not already completed.
