- Check all occurences of GLib::Roles::TypedBuffer and remove all casts involving the .p method. Those casts are no longer necessary.
  If a cast is to a different type than the role parameter then the call becomes ".p( :!typed )"
- Anywhere where the .Array method is used, consider adding the ability to use ".List" which will return an iterator object and
  may need to be created in the referenced class! .List should be its own method.
- There is still a bit of confusion between setting properties and setting data in GLib::Roles::Object. Please resolve this.
- All methods that return the results of a .map should have that value coerced to an array. This WILL have unforseen consequences,
  but let's hope they are minor. It's either that or have a :$seq var on all routines that defaults to TRUE.
