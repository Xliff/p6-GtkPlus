GTK+ Regression Testing 4/3/2019
================================

  1: PASSED
  2: PASSED
  3: PASSED
  4: PASSED
  5: PASSED
  6: PASSED
  7: PASSED
  8: PASSED
  9: MARGINAL. Eventually PASSED after several run thrus, but there looks 
     to be a flapping issue with reference counts dropping below 0. Once this
     happens, cascade failures appear everywhere, eventually leading to a 
     SEGV. This is probably due to faulty GC. May not be fixed until 
     allocation is handled at the POINTER, not object, level. Could also be
     a container issue.
 10: PASSED
 11: PASSED
 12: PASSED
 14: PASSED
 15: PASSED
 16: PASSED
 17: PASSED
 18: PASSED
 19: PASSED (after fixing minor issue in GTK::Stack). Ends with GTK warning 
     about floating object reference.
 20: PASSED
 21: PASSED. Opening the Interactive Dialog button more than once will cause 
     GTK messages to be emitted, but this does not seem to affect 
     functionality. Messages only seem to be emitted when text boxes change.
 22: MARGINAL. No errors occur, but behavior does NOT match that of the GTK
     demo.
 23: PASSED
 24: MARGINAL. Wave is drawn and can switch between SIN and COS, but drawing
     will eventually stop and app will hang.
 25: PASSED (After applying a minor fix to GTK::Roles::Protection)
 26: PASSED
 27: PASSED (After a few fixes to both test file and GTK::Box)
 28: PASSED 
 29: PASSED
 30: PASSED
 31: PASSED (Although a number of GTK warnings about floating objects do appear
     at startup)
 32: PASSED
 33: PASSED (After fixes to GTK::IconInfo)
 34: PASSED (For some reason, the 8th image is not showing up)
 35: BROKEN (GList used to implement p6sort, that has been removed. Will
     have to circle back once GList is in a working state)
     BROKEN -> MARGINAL (4/4)
     After updates to GTK::Compat::GList and GTK::Compat::Roles::ListData, this
     example is now MARGINAL. Primary drag and drop functionality has been 
     restored, along with all icon categories, however the drag and drop of 
     categories within the palette still does not work as expected. 
     Upon termination, numerous GTK warnings are emitted, along with the 
     following:
     
           Cannot look up attributes in a GTK::Compat::Types::GObjectStruct type object
        in method ref_count at /usr/local/home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GtkPlus/lib/GTK/Compat/Types.pm6 (GTK::Compat::Types) line 43
        in submethod DESTROY at /usr/local/home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GtkPlus/lib/GTK/Widget.pm6 (GTK::Widget) line 68
        in method CALL-ME at /usr/local/home/cbwood/Projects/rakudobrew/moar-master/install/bin/../share/perl6/sources/947BDAB9F96E0E5FCCB383124F923A6BF6F8D76B (NativeCall) line 587
        in method run at /usr/local/home/cbwood/Projects/p6-GtkPlus/lib/GTK/Application.pm6 (GTK::Application) line 169
        in block <unit> at t/35-dnd.t line 411
   
 36: PASSED (After fixing $was_symbolic parameters in GTK::IconInfo)
 37: PASSED
 38: PASSED
 39: PASSED
39b: PASSED
 40: UNKNOWN - (GTK::Grid child tracking has not yet been completed to my 
     satisfaction. This test will need to be examined more closely)
 41: UNKNOWN - (When setting horizontal scrolling to never, must establish 
     maximum window size. Either that or limit the example to NOT allow window 
     to grow larger than the screen size with acceptable margins. Also, must
     make it so window can shrink once this occurs.)
 50: PASSED
 52: BROKEN - (GTK::Utils::MenuBuilder in the process of being refactored)
 54: BROKEN - SegFaults when progress bar reaches end.
 62: INCOMPLETE
 72: INCOMPLETE (testing GTK Builder templates)
